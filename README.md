# spotify-autoAddArtists

simply get all your followed artists, specify one or several playlist per artist and create the playlists automatically

*tested on python 3.6*


to do:


- on playlistInput.html:

- - make a data list fed on input change

- - replace current url by the spotify url to open the desktop app

- - add a remove input button

- -  put inputs in table and move the add and remove input button on the first column

- - use requests.form.getlist server side instead of the js shenanigans

- - cancel default action on keypress enter to avoid accidental form submit since it take forever to compute

- build a real model tho
- write a decent readme on how to install and use
